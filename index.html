        <div>PROJECTS</div>
        <div>
          <div>Web App for Inventory Tracking</div>
          <div>
            Built an inventory tracking web app with all store related
            functionality using Full stack Javascript technologies. I used
            <ul>
              <li>NodeJS backend</li>
              <li>ExpressJS web server</li>
              <li>Angular frontend</li>
              <li>MongoDB database</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
              This web app is being used internally for daily operations.

        <div>
          <div>Biometric Attendance System</div>
          <div>
            Built a web based biometric attendance system. Wrote C++ libraries
            to nodejs bindings to access device APIs. The device was connected
            to server hosting the web app to track attendance. Angular and
            bootstrap was used to build the web app. This app was used till the
            roll out of enterprise wide access control system.

          <div>Asset Tracking using Bluetooth Low Energy</div>
          <div>
            For real time position tracking of high value assets, I developed a
            system involving low cost raspberry pi based scanners and BLE
            beacons. Beacons were attached to high value assets. Readers placed
            in each zone read realtime broadcasts of beacons and relayed data to
            a server connected through Ethernet. A web app showed real time
            location of high value inventory
